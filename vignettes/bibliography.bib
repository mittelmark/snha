 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

   Abstract={(1) Background: We present a new statistical approach labeled as "St. Nicolas House Analysis" (SNHA) for detecting and visualizing extensive interactions among variables. (2) Method: We rank absolute bivariate correlation coefficients in descending order according to magnitude and create hierarchic "association chains" defined by sequences where reversing start and end point does not alter the ordering of elements. Association chains are used to characterize dependence structures of interacting variables by a graph. (3) Results: SNHA depicts association chains in highly, but also in weakly correlated data, and is robust towards spurious accidental associations. Overlapping association chains can be visualized as network graphs. Between independent variables significantly fewer associations are detected compared to standard correlation or linear model-based approaches. (4) Conclusion: We propose reversible association chains as a principle to detect dependencies among variables. The proposed method can be conceptualized as a non-parametric statistical method. It is especially suited for secondary data analysis as only aggregate information such as correlations matrices are required. The analysis provides an initial approach for clarifying potential associations that may be subject to subsequent hypothesis testing.}

   Abstract={Background: Multiple linear correlations between parameters can be shown 
   in correlation matrices. Correlations can be ranked, but can also be visualized in 
   network graphs. Yet, translating a correlation matrix into a network graph is not 
   trivial. In view of a popular child game, we propose to name this method 
   St. Nicolas House Analysis. 
   Material and methods: 
   We present a new method (St. Nicolas House Analysis) that helps translating 
   correlation matrices into network graphs. The performance of this and other 
   network reconstruction methods was tested in randomly created virtual scale-free 
   networks, networks consisting of bands or hubs, using balanced classification 
   rate and the F1-Score for correctly predicting existing and non-existing edges. 
   Thereafter we analyzed anthropometric data and information on parental education, 
   obtained from an anthropometric survey in 908 Indonesian boys and 808 Indonesian 
   girls. Seven parameters were analyzed: child height standard deviation score (hSDS), 
   child BMI standard deviation scores (BMI_SDS), mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC),
   mean thickness of subscapular and triceps skinfold (mean SF), and elbow breadth; 
   as well as maternal and paternal education (years of schooling). 
   The parameters were considered as the nodes of the network; the edges represent 
   the correlations between the nodes. Results: Performance measures, 
   balanced classification rate and the F1-score, showed that 
   St. Nicolas' House Analysis was superior to methods using sophisticated 
   correlation value thresholds and methods based on partial correlations for 
   analyzing bands and hubs. We applied this method also in an Indonesia data set. 
   Ranking correlations showed the direct association between parental education and 
   child growth. 
   Conclusion: St. Nicolas House Analysis confirmed that growth of 
   Indonesian school children directly depends on maternal education, 
   with no evidence that this effect is mediated by the state of nutrition.}
